/**
 * Consider a row of n coins of values v1 . . . vn, where n is even.
 * We play a game against an opponent by alternating turns.
 *
 * In each turn, a player selects either the first or last coin from the row,
 * removes it from the row permanently, and receives the value of the coin.
 *
 * Determine the maximum possible amount of money we can definitely win if YOU move first.
 *
 *
 *
 * Case 1 - If you pick coin v[i] :
 * Then the opponent has the choice between v(i+1) and v(j).
 *
 *  If the opponent takes v(i+1), the remaining coins are { v(i+2) â€¦ v(j)},
 *  for which our maximum is denoted by A(i+2, j).
 *
 *  On the other hand, if the opponent takes v[j] our maximum is A(i+1, j-1).
 * 
 * Since the opponent is as smart as you, he would have chosen the choice that yields the minimum amount to you.
 * Therefore, the maximum amount you can get when you choose v[i] is:
 *  C1 = v[i] + min { A(i+2, j), A(i+1, j-1) }
 * 
 * Case 2 - If you pick coin v[j] :
 * Similar to case 1, the maximum amount you can get when you choose v[j] is:
 *  C2 = v[j] + min { A(i+1, j-1), A(i, j-2) }
 *  
 *  Therefore
 *  A(i, j)  = max { C1, C2 }= max { v[i] + min { A(i+2, j),   A(i+1, j-1) }
 *                                   ,v[j] + min { A(i+1, j-1), A(i,   j-2) } }
